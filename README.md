# Dotfiles for VS Code

These are an opinionated set of configuration files for Visual Studio Code.

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone The Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SteveDeWald/Dotfiles-VSCode.git
```

### Step 2: Run The Install Script (MacOS only)

```bash
./Dotfiles-VSCode/install.sh
```

_**Warning**: this will overwrite your existing configuration files!_

The install script will do several things for you:

- Symlinks your VS Code configuration files to the one in this directory
- Installs recommended extensions
- Enables keyboard repeat in VS Code on MacOS
